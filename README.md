# Mute It Watch App
### An Apple Watch App made for my friends [Unicorn Witnesses](https://unicornwitnesses.com/). 
#### It's made for mental health. Smooth water dropping sound helps to avoid discomfort from silence and embarrassing sounds.

It still has issues with audio interruption when you turn your wrist, so feel free to take part. 

For the most positive user experience switch the Wake Duration in the Display and Brightness settings of your watch to 70 seconds.
